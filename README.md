TopoDroid code base

This is the TopoDroid app (com.topodroid.TDX) repository.

TopoDroid is a productivity Android app for cave surveying.
It is specially designed to do cave surveying with the DistoX (v. 1, 2, and BLE), the Cavway X1, the BRIC (4 and 5), and the SAP (5 and 6)
although it can be profitably used even without it.

The most recent TopoDroid apks, as well as recent version changes info, are on http://marcocorvi.altervista.org/caving/speleoapps/speleoapks/TopoDroidApks.html
