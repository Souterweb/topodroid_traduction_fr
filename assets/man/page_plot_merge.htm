<h4>SKETCH MERGE AND SPLIT</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
In the <i>Sketch rename/delete</i> dialog you can either rename or delete the opened sketch.<br><p>

If <i>split/merge</i> [G] is enabled there are also buttons to split/copy the sketch (ie, extract part of the drawings creating a
new sketch), include the display of the outlies of other sketches,
and merge the drawings of the sketch shown as outline in the current sketch.
<br><p>

<b>Sketch split</b><br>
The split button creates a new sketch populated with items selected from the current sketch.
To select these items trace a border surrounding them in the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br>
You can specify the name of the new sketch. However its origin is the same as that of the current sketch.
Likewise it has the same type of profile view as the current sketch.<br>
If the <u>Drawing window</u> is displaying the plan view, the new sketch plan view is populated with the selected items, and the profile view
is empty. The converse, if the <u>Drawing window</u> is displaying the profile view.<br>
Only visible items are selected for the split.<br>
<p>

You can choose whether to move the selected items to the new sketch or only to copy them to it.<br><p>

After this operation the <u>Drawing window</u> displays the new sketch.<br><p>

<b>Sketch outline</b><br>
With this button a new dialog is opened to select another sketch that is shown in outline (only the walls)
on the display.<br><p>

<b>Sketch merge</b><br>
If the outline of another sketch is being displayed you can merge it within the current sketch.<br>
The items of the outlined sketch are copied in the current sketch.<br><p>
