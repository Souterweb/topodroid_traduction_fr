<h4>SURVEY IMPORT</h4>

This dialog is opened with a tap on the <i>Import</i> button of the <u>Main window</u>.<br><p>

TopoDroid imports survey data from TopoDroid zip archives or from external files.<br>
To import files or zip archives tap on the "Import" button.
Files and zip archives are selected through a system filemanager.<br>
The name of the file must not contain a colon ':'.<br><p>

The dialog displays the list of supported import file formats, besides "zip" archives:
<ul>
<li>Compass (dat)</li>
<li>Survex (svx)</li>
<li>Therion. Only data (th)</li>
<li>VisualTopo (tro and trox)</li>
<li>Walls (srv)</li>
<li>TopoRobot</li>
<li>PocketTopo, including sketches (top)</li>
<li>CaveSniper (csn)</li>
<li>BRIC csv (csv)</li>
</ul><br>

For some formats it is possible to customize the import through a few flags.<br>

A file import fails if a survey with the same name is already in TopoDroid.<br><p>
The import file is selected with the system content provider.<br><p>

On import from file, LRUD values are converted to x-splays (shown in green).<br><p>


<b>Compass import</b><br>
<ul>
<li><i>LRUD</i> if enabled LRUD values are imported and converted to splay shots</li>
<li><i>Leg first</i> if enabled LRUD splays are placed after the leg</li>
<li><i>Diving datamode</i> enable for data diving mode in the Compass file [T]</li>
</ul><br><p>

TopoDroid converts imported compass survey from <i>normal</i> datamode to <i>diving</i> datamode [T], if the relative setting is enabled [G].<br><p>

<b>Survex import</b><br>
<u>Survex syntax is partially supported</u>.<br>

Only the data modes "normal", "topofil" and "passage" are handled to some extent.
In particular for the "passage" data mode, the "left" and "right" values are not used because
they cannot be converted to splays.<br>

TopoDroid has only single survey sessions. Therefore, data of multi-session files are merged in a 
single session.
<br><p>

<b>Therion import</b><br>
<u>Therion syntax is partially supported</u>.<br>

Only Therion survey files with data in "normal" datamode are importable.<br>
The "declination" command is taken into account: the read azimuth are corrected with the value
of the declination.<br>
If the station short-names have no clash the file can be imported with "short-names". 
Otherwise it must be imported with full names, ie station names qualified by the survey path.<br>
TopoDroid does not import Therion scraps.<br><p>

<b>VisualTopo import</b><br>
<u>VisualTopo syntax is partially supported</u>.<br>

VisualTopo (tro, trox) import options:
<ul>
<li><i>LRUD</i> if enabled LRUD values are imported and converted to splay shots</li>
<li><i>Leg first</i> if enabled LRUD splays are placed after the leg</li>
</ul><br>

TopoDroid can import also VisualTopo surveys with <i>Prof</i> instead of <i>Clino</i> in "trox" format.
The data are stored in <i>diving</i> datamode.<br><p>

<b>Walls import</b><br>
<u>Walls syntax is partially supported</u>.<br>

Importing data from a Walls file can result in disconnected survey.<br><p>

<b>TopoRobot import</b><br>
TopoRobot import is very experimental.<br><p>

<b>PocketTopo import</b><br>
TopoDroid imports both the survey data and the sketches.
This import maps PocketTopo colors to TopoDroid drawing tools (points and lines).
The mapping can be modified through a setting.<br><p>

<b>CaveSniper import</b><br>
<br><p>

<b>BRIC csv file</b><br>
BRIC csv import is experimental.<br>

Survey data imported from BRIC csv files contains only distance, azimuth, and inclination.<br>
The survey data must be edited after importing to add the other information.<br><p>

<!--
<b>N.B.</b>
Import may fail (and crash the app) due to failure on the database that TopoDroid cannot intercept.
If this happens delete the partially imported survey and retry to import it.<br><p>
