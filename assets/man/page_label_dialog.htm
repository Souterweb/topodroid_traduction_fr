<div style="font-size=90%">
<b>Canvas views</b> (layers)<br>
The canvas views are presented as checkboxes with the view letter-code.
By default labels belongs to the "base" and "artifact" views.
It is possible to switch off some views.
<br><p>
Beware that, if the label is not assigned to a visible view, it will not appear in the canvas
even if it is actually added to the sketch. In this case, however, the label point will be visible in edit mode, so that 
the label edit dialog can be opened and the label assigned to a canvas view.
