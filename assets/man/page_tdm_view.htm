<h4>Project Plan View</h4>

The <u>Project Plan View window</u> is presented when you tap the <i>Plan</i> button in the <u>Project Manager</u> window.<br>

It displays selected surveys of the cave project on the horizontal plane (thus in plan view), with midline and station names.
<br><p>

<p>Each survey has a different color.
After a while the colors repeat therefore you should display only two or three surveys at a time.<br>
The display can be panned and zoomed in/out.
</p>

By selecting a station of one survey (tapping on its name) that survey can be dragged around while keeping the others fixed.<br>
By this means the station can be brought close to a station of another survey.<br>
The two stations can be selected at the same time with a tap nearby, and an "equate" between the two stations added to the cave project.<br><p>
Equates are shown as dashed red lines, and equated stations have a round background.

The size of the station names is equal to that in the <u>Drawing window</u>.<p>

Equates can be also added manually through the <a href="page_tdm_equate_new.htm">Equate Dialog</a>.
The list of equates is shown with the <a href="page_tdm_equates.htm">Equates Dialog</a>, through which they can be removed from the cave project.<br><p>
