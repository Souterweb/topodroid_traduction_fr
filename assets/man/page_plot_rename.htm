<h4>SKETCH OPERATIONS</h4>

<div style="font-size=90%">
With this dialog you can do maintenance operations on the sketch:
<ul>
<li>delete the sketch</li>
<li>change the name of the sketch</li>
<li>change the origin station of the sketch [T]</li>
<li>split the sketch and create a new sketch moving or copying drawing items to it</li>
<li>move or copy drawing items to a new scrap of the sketch</li>
<li>move or copy drawing items in a buffer</li>
<li>clear the item buffer or paste them in a scrap</li>
<li>select another sketch and add it to the outlines of the current sketch</li>
<li>merge the items of the outline sketches in the current sketch</li>
</ul><br><p>

The dialog is opened from the <i>Operations</i> menu of the <u>Drawing window</u>.<br><p>

It has a field for the new name of the sketch (or the name of the new sketch in case of "split")
and a text box with the sketch reference station (sketch origin).<br>
<!-- The reference station can be modified only at "Tester" level.<br> --><p> 

Type the new sketch name in the edit box, and tap the <i>Rename</i> button to confirm.<br><p>

The <i>Delete</i> button marks the sketch as "deleted". It can be recovered with the <u>Survey Data window</u>
<i>recover</i> menu.<br><p>

With the <i>sketch</i> button [T] you can cut a portion of the sketch and save it as a new sketch.
You must write the name of the new sketch in the edit box.
The base station of the new sketch is the same as that of the current sketch.<br>
With the check box you choose whether to copy or to move the selected items to the new sketch.<br>
After you press the <i>sketch</i> button you must select the items of the sketch to move/copy
by tracing a line around them.<br><p>

With the <i>scrap</i> button [T] the selected items are copied or moved to a new scrap.<br><p>

With the <i>buffer</i> button they are put in a buffer.<br>
The buffered items can be pasted to a scrap with the <i>Paste</i> button.<br>
The <i>Clear</i> button empties the buffer.<br><p>

<b>Outlines</b><br>
The <i>Select</i> button opens a dialog to pick another sketch and add its outline as a reference.
The outlines are not saved with the sketch, and are lost when the sketch is closed.<br>
The <i>Merge</i> button copies the items of the sketches shown in outline in the current sketch.<br><p>

Close the dialog with the <i>Cancel</i> button to cancel.<br><p>

<!-- b>Base station </b><br><p>

At <i>Tester</i> level the sketch base station can be changed.<br>
Beware that changing the base station
shifts the centerline, and the section lines and points since these reference the shifted legs 
and stations. The other items of the sketch are not shifted.
